The browser opens automatically and you can preview the blog on your laptop or desktop.
Even if you run the easy-hugo-preview command many times, only one hugo process will run so do not mind it.
Since the process of hugo running in the laptop or desktop disappears in 300 seconds, you do not have to worry about killing hugo process.

Set `easy-hugo-server-flags` to `-D` in order to preview drafts.

### Prepare the server

Let's build with a free trial of "google compute engine" or "amazon ec2".
If you want deploy hugo at GitHub Pages or Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, This paragraph is not necessary.
I created my blog in google compute engine.
Check if rsync is installed on the server.

Write at ~/.ssh/config on your laptop or desktop.

	 Host blogdomain
         HostName "Your server's IP"
         User "Your server's ssh login username"

Because blog is generated under /home/blog/ on the server, set it to reference it with nginx.
SSL uses certbot (Let's encrypt).

sample nginx.conf

	server {
		listen 80;
		server_name yourdomain;
		return  301 https://yourdomain$request_uri;
		location / {
			root /home/blog;
		index	index.html index.htm;
		}
	}
	server {
		listen 443;
		server_name yourdomain;
		ssl on;
		ssl_certificate      /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain/fullchain.pem;
		ssl_certificate_key  /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain/privkey.pem;

	location / {
		root    /home/blog;
	index   index.html index.htm;
		}
	}
